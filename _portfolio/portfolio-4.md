* Explored wormhole solutions within f(R, T) gravity framework, utilizing the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Metric and Power and Exponential Law methodologies. 
* Introduced a novel exponential shape function in wormhole geometry, deriving energy conditions and equation of state parameters to validate the proposed model, with productivity and accuracy improved by Mathematica

* Designed and trained a Faster R-CNN with OCR model for CIMA+, meticulously annotating
and preparing a comprehensive training dataset from survey data, leading to efficient detection,
localization, and classification of electric fuse types, saving 100+ hours of manual labor
* Engineered an Active Learning System for precise labeling and analysis of electrical circuit dia-
grams, integrating advanced computer vision to enhance workflow efficiency in interpreting and
processing designs

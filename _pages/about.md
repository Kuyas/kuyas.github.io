Hi, I’m Shreyas Sunil Kulkarni, an Applied Scientist II at Amazon’s International Machine Learning team. I’m passionate about exploring how AI can bring together different types of information—like visuals and text—to solve real-world problems in smarter, more efficient ways.

With a background in computer vision, natural language processing, and building scalable AI systems, I’ve worked on projects that push boundaries, making AI more reliable, practical, and sustainable. My journey has taken me through both academia and industry, where I’ve had the privilege of working on impactful projects at Amazon and collaborating with amazing researchers around the world.

At the heart of it all, I believe in creating AI that’s not just cutting-edge but also trustworthy and mindful of its impact. Thanks for stopping by—this is where innovation meets purpose!
